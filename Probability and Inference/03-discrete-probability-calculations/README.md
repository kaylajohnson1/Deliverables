World Series 
============

## **How often does the better team win the World Series?**

In this assignment, I am tasked with using the rules of probability and discrete probability functions to answer questions about the World Series. 
The World Series is a **best-of-7** matchup between the champions of the American and National Leagues of Major League Baseball. 

### Setup for the World Series

1. In this delivarable the **Braves** and the **Yankees** compete to see who will win. 
2. In any given game, the probability that the Braves win is *P*<sub>*B*</sub> and the probability that the Yankees win is
    *P*<sub>*Y*</sub> = 1 − *P*<sub>*B*</sub>.


### Some questions that will be answered are:

1. What is the probability that the Braves win the World Series given that *P*<sub>*B*</sub> = 0.55?

2. What is the probability that the Braves win the World Series given that *P*<sub>*B*</sub> = x? This will be a figure with *P*<sub>*B*</sub> on the x-axis and P(Braves win World Series) on the y-axis.

3. Suppose one could change the World Series to be best-of-9 or some other best-of-X series. What is the shortest series length so that P(Braves win World Series|PB = .55) ≥ 0.8?

4. What is the shortest series length so that P(Braves win World Series|*P*<sub>*B*</sub> = x) ≥ 0.8? This will be a figure with *P*<sub>*B*</sub> on the x-axis and series length is the y-axis.

5. Calculate P(*P*<sub>*B*</sub> = 0.55|Braves win World Series in 7 games) under the assumption that either *P*<sub>*B*</sub> = 0.55 or *P*<sub>*B*</sub> = 0.45.
