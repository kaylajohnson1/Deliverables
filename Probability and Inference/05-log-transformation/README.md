# Log Transform 

In this assignment I will answer a series of questions related to the transformation of data. I will use both analytic methods and simulation to anser the questions

# Part 1

- For each distribution, I will generate a figure of the PDF and CDF. The mean and median will also be marked in the figure.

- For each distribution, I will generate a figure of the PDF and CDF of the transformation Y = log(X) random variable. I will mark the mean and mean in the figure. I will use either simulation or analytic methids in order to find the PDF and CDF of the transformation.

- For each of the distributions, I will genereate 1000 samples of size 100. For each sample, I will calculate the geometric and arithmetic sample means. I will add a line of identity as a reference line.

_ I will generate a histogram of the difference between the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean, 

## Distributions 

Here are the three distributions:

### Distribution 1

*X* ∼ GAMMA(shape = 3, scale = 1)

### Distribution 2

*X* ∼ LOG NORMAL(*μ* =  − 1, *σ* = 1)

### Distribution 3

*X* ∼ UNIFORM(0, 12)

## Part 2 

I will show that if *X*<sub>*i*</sub> \> 0 for all *i*, then the arithmetic
mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean.

Hint: I will start with the sample mean of the transformation
*Y*<sub>*i*</sub> = log (*X*<sub>*i*</sub>).

## Part 3

I will answer the question: What is the correct relationship between *E*\[log (*X*)\] and
log (*E*\[*X*\])? Is one always larger? Equal? Then, I will explain my answer.
