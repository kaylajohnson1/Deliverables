## Probability & Inference (Fall 2020)

In this course, I study the fundamentals of probability theory and statistical inference. Some of the relevant topics include: random variables, distributions, expectations, moments, Jensenâ€™s inequality, law of large numbers, central limit theorem. Topics in inference include maximum likelihood, point estimation (Bayesian, frequentist, and likelihood versions); hypothesis and significance testing; re-sampling techniques. Complex mathematical proofs will be illustrated with computational solutions.

In order to show mastery of the concepts taught in this course, deliverables will be completed and uploaded to my portfolio.
