Which quantiles of a continuous distribution can one estimate with more precision?
==================================================================================

The median is an important quantity in data analysis. It represents the
middle value of the data distribution. Estimates of the median, however,
have a degree of uncertainty because (a) the estimates are calculated
from a finite sample and (b) the data distribution of the underlying
data is generally unknown. As a data scientist, I am able to 
quantify and to communicate the degree of uncertainty through data analysis. 

Assignment
----------

In this deliverable, I will answer a series of
questions related to the variation of the median (and a range of other
quantiles). I will use analytic methods to answer the questions.
