Roulette
========
## **Do you want to win a couple bucks?**
In this assignment, I am tasked with exploring the option of using the **Martingale strategy** strategy to play roulette. 

### Here is a brief explanation of how it works: 

If you play roulette with this strategy you have a good chance of walking away with some money **(but don't quit
your day job, because the house always wins in the end)**. On the first round of the game place a $1 wager on red. If the
ball lands on red, then $1 will be wagered on red once again. If the ball does not land on red, then the wager for the next
play is twice times the amount of money lot on the previous play. Check out my code to see how this strategy can help you walk out with money!  

### Here are some things that I accomplish in this assignment:

**1.** I used computer simulation to calculate the average earnings of a gambler who uses the martingale strategy. 

**2.** I show how changing a parameter of the simulation impacts the average earnings.

**3.** I use computer simulation to to estimate the number of plays before stopping

**4.** I explore the limitations of the simulation.
