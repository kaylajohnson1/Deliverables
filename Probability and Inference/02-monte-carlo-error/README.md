Monte Carlo Simulation
======================
## **The relationship between replications and simulation error**
In this assignment, I am tasked with demonstrating the concepts of absolute error and relative error when estimating probabilities from simulation. 

### With the concepts of absolute and relative error I will:

1. Explain why the concepts are important
2. introduce key vocabulary terms, and
3. Demonstrate the concepts in action

In this deliverable I perform a 14 X 5 factorial experiment
simulation that estimates the error for each combination of replicate
number (2<sup>2</sup>, 2<sup>3</sup>, …, 2<sup>15</sup>) and probability
(0.01, 0.05, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50). *p̂* denotes the probability estimated
from simulation, and *p* denotes the true underlying probability.

### Absolute and relative error are calculated as:

**absolute error** = \|*p̂*−*p*\|

and

**relative error** = \|*p̂*−*p*\|/*p*.

*Throughout the experiment, I explain the procedures and interpret the results.*
